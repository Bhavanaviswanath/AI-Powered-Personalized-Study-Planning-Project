## 📚 How It Works
User login/registration

AI analyzes performance and generates a custom plan using RL.

Student receives daily & weekly study plans

Rewards and penalties based on performance

Real-time performance tracking through graphs and feedback

## 🧠 AI & RL Logic
State: Learning progress, subject priority, user focus patterns

Action: Allocate study time to subjects

Reward: +1 for goal achieved, -1 for missed tasks

Model: Q-Learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN)
